# Design-of-nor-gate-schematic-and-layout
---
This project contains the design of an CMOS nor gate with representing it the form of schematic and layout design. We can see the working of an nor gate with respect to the input applied and their output which can be represented in the form of an waveforms. The design will utilize the models that are present in under the __skywater 130nm pdk__ and various open source tools such as, __Xschem__, __NGSPICE__, __MAGIC__, __Netgen__, etc.

Let's get right into it.
